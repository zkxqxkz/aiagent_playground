## Plan for Optimizing the Given LLVM IR Code

### 1. Current Bottleneck with Respect to the Machine

The machine running the code is an Intel(R) Xeon(R) Platinum 8462Y+ with 128 cores and a substantial L2 and L3 cache. The bottleneck here is likely not utilizing the full potential of parallel computation that such a multi-core architecture offers. The current implementation of the matrix multiplication is inherently sequential, which limits the ability to leverage the available cores for parallel processing.

### 2. Current Bottleneck with Respect to the Operations in the Given IR Code

The IR code performs a triple nested loop for matrix multiplication, where the innermost loop is a straightforward implementation of dot product calculations. The bottleneck here involves:
- Inefficient use of memory: The code repeatedly accesses memory locations for matrix elements, potentially causing cache misses, particularly when the matrices are large.
- Lack of vectorization: The current IR code does not utilize SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) instructions, which can significantly speed up operations like floating-point multiplications and additions.

### 3. What Can be Optimized and What Will be Done

- **Parallelization**: We can parallelize the outermost loop to distribute computations across multiple cores. This can be achieved by using OpenMP pragmas or LLVM's OpenMP support to create parallel threads.
  
- **Vectorization**: By utilizing LLVM's vectorization capabilities, we can enable SIMD instructions. This involves rewriting parts of the code to use LLVM's vector operations, which will allow multiple data points to be processed in a single instruction.

- **Loop Unrolling**: The innermost loop can benefit from loop unrolling, which can reduce the overhead of loop control and increase instruction-level parallelism.

- **Memory Access Optimization**: Improving data locality by using blocking techniques can reduce cache misses. This involves processing sub-blocks of matrices that fit into cache rather than the entire matrix.

### 4. Why the Planned Optimization is Correct and Faster

- **Parallelization**: With 128 cores, parallelizing the outer loop allows for concurrent execution of multiple iterations, drastically reducing execution time for large matrices.

- **Vectorization**: SIMD instructions enable the processor to execute multiple operations in a single instruction cycle. This is particularly effective for operations like element-wise multiplications and additions, which are prevalent in matrix multiplication.

- **Loop Unrolling**: By reducing the loop overhead and increasing the number of operations per loop iteration, loop unrolling can help achieve better performance through increased instruction throughput.

- **Memory Access Optimization**: By ensuring that data accessed together is stored together, blocking reduces cache misses and memory latency, allowing for faster data retrieval and processing.

### CHANGES TO BE MADE:

1. **Add Parallelization**: Introduce parallelization for the outer loop to leverage the machine's multi-core architecture. Use OpenMP or LLVM's parallel constructs.

2. **Enable Vectorization**: Modify the IR code to use LLVM's vector operations. This can include changing scalar operations to vector operations where possible.

3. **Implement Loop Unrolling**: Apply loop unrolling to the innermost loop to reduce loop overhead and increase instruction-level parallelism.

4. **Optimize Memory Access**: Implement blocking techniques to improve data locality and reduce cache misses, ensuring that sub-blocks of the matrices fit into cache levels.

By applying these changes, the optimized LLVM IR code will better utilize the available hardware resources and execute faster than the original code.
